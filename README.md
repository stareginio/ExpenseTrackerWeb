# Expense Tracker - A Web Application
This project was made for our course, Applications Development and Emerging Technologies 2 (Enterprise-Back-End).
We were tasked to create a web application (using JSPs) with a MySQL database.
Aside from that, we were also asked to apply what we have learned from
freeCodeCamp's [Responsive Web Design tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/).
